# [DEADLINE] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Dumpz]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [ANEENA OT] - [Jyothi Engineering College]
- Member 2: [Abhinav S] - [Jyothi Engineering College]

### Project Description
[Deadline is a web-based prediction tool that estimates your death age from given symptoms or habits and predicts whether you‚Äôll go to heaven or hell. It creates an engaging experience with heartbeat sounds during prediction and themed audio for the final outcome.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Nobody knows exactly when they‚Äôll die or where they‚Äôll end up in the afterlife‚Ä¶
We decided to fix that problem ‚Äî in the most inaccurate and unscientific way possible.
]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Our project uses an interactive frontend interface to estimate a user‚Äôs predicted death age based on their habits or symptoms, and determines whether they go to heaven or hell. It engages users with sound effects to create a tense and immersive experience, addressing the curiosity around life expectancy in a fun and fictional way.]
